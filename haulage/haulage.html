   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">So that the Haulage Committee may take an accurate assessment of the space requirements for winter sites, it is essential that the “Application for Haulage” form is completed and returned to the Club Secretary or Haulage Master, along with a non refundable deposit of $100, not later than the 30th April.</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Applications will be on a first come first served basis where possible. Applica-tions for winter haulage received by the 30th April will have absolute priority over available space on the section.</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Late applications will be considered in the light of space available, with the possibility that a winter site may be refused.</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Winter haulage will not be granted to members who are in arrears with ac-counts.</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Demand for winter haulage may exceed the space available on the section and in the event, the Club may limit a number of boats to short term haulage.</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Before winter haulage commences all boat owners are required to attend a working bee and an informal meeting (which will be held on the day of the working bee) to discuss the requirements of haulage.</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Failure to attend on the day of the working bee, and the informal meeting, may exclude a person from haulage.</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Winter Haulage starts in May and ceases on or about the second weekend in November (decided annually by the Haulage committee).<a name="3"></a></span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Persons wishing to have their boat hauled are to make themselves familiar with the contents of the Haulage Manual, a copy of which is held in the Clubhouse and which will be made available to them on request.</span></li>
   </ol>
   <p>&nbsp;<strong  class="btn btn-black"><span style="line-height: 1.5;">3. Sale of Boats while on the Haulage Area</span></strong></p>
   <ol>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Should a boat be sold while on the slipway or haulout area the vendor is re-quired to inform the purchaser that the boat and new owner will remain subject to the Club Haulage Policy for as long as the boat remains on the section.</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">The Vendor is required to notify the Haulage Master of the Change of Owner-ship when the sale is finalised and confirm that he has made the new owner aware of the above clause</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">The new owner must accept that the terms of occupancy require that the Club Haulage Policy is adhered to at all times while the boat remains on the section<a name="4"></a></span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">The vendor member is still liable for all charges and penalties owing to the Club in respect of the boat involved, and is also responsible for the activities around the boat until such time as payment is received from the new owner of the balance of haulage charges and the boat is removed from the section or the new owner/s is an approved full member of the Club.</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">The new owner(s) is/are to be encouraged to join the Club if it is practical for them to do so.</span></li>
   </ol>
   <p><strong  class="btn btn-black">4. The Haulage Process</strong></p>
   <ol>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Haulage is a co-operative effort using volunteers. The Haulage Master or his nominated representative, who shall be a trained haulage operator, only advises on the haulage work in hand and remains at the winch controls. A second Haulage Operator will act as Haulage Foreman liaising with the boat-owner and the first Haulage Operator at the winch to ensure that the haulage is carried out in a safe manner and will delegate other persons to assist with particular aspects of the haulage process as may be required. However, the boat-owner retains the responsibility for the haulage of his boat.</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">No person shall use the Club’s gear for hauling up, launching or otherwise, unless they are a nominated Haulage Operator. No person shall remove a boat from the section without prior approval of the Haulage Master. All movements must be under the control of the Haulage Master or his representative.</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">The boat owner is responsible for the prior organisation of all labour for the control of his boat, laying out and use of the Clubs gear, moving his boat, re-placing the Club’s gear in the workshop and immediately removing all his own gear and debris from the section. The slipway trolley should be greased by the boat-owner after every time it is used. A capable crew of at least three able-bodied adults is necessary, for the safe and efficient movement of most boats.&nbsp;</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">All vessels hauled out must have work carried out on a regular and methodical basis, thus ensuring their target downhaul date is achieved with a minimum of frustration to owner and neighbouring vessel owners alike.</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">All basic functions, i.e. scrubbing off, rubbing down and other dirt and dust producing work should be carried directly after uphaul and completed in the shortest period of time possible. This allows for lost time, due to inclement weather later, also giving the longest time span to pick the right conditions for final painting, etc.</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Interior work should only be done when exterior work is finished, or if not pos-sible due to weather, or owner’s other activities, daylight conditions or similar genuine reasons. Final painting, etc should be carried out sufficiently before downhaul to allow for hardening and with regard to neighbouring boat-owner’s activities.</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Your haulout period must be a time of full co-operation with other section us-ers. At the first opportunity, discuss with work programmes with adjacent boat-owners in order that clashes do not occur later, which lead to ruined work and frayed tempers. If you have any concerns regarding your haulage obliga-tions, please contact the Haulage Master.&nbsp;</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">The Haulage Committee in consultation with boat-owners sets uphaul and downhaul dates for winter haulage. The actual uphaul and downhaul dates will be confirmed by the Haulage Master on the noticeboard / Haulage Board. Ad-verse weather may force last minute changes to these dates. All owners should be ready to haul as soon as the preceding boat is in position. If you have any particular requirements, please contact the Haulage Master. However it may not be possible to please everyone.<a name="5"></a></span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">It should be noted that if a boat owner deviates from these Rules of the Devonport Yacht Club in any way without the consent of the Haulage Master or his appointed representative, then the Devonport Yacht Club may impose a financial penalty. Other member’s boats or cradles or property damaged may claim financially from that boat owner.</span></li>
   </ol>
   <p><strong  class="btn btn-black">&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.5;">5. Cradles</span></strong></p>
   <ol>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">The proper assembly of the cradle is the responsibility of the boat’s owner (s). All bolts and mechanical fastenings should be in good condition and properly tightened.</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">The materials the cradle is constructed from should be of sufficient strength to cope with the stresses of hauling the boat over an uneven surface.</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Steel cradles shall have a minimum of 25mm of hardwood on the underside of the main bearers.</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">All cradles will have fore and aft spreaders and diagonals between the main bearers to prevent twisting during side haulage. (A diagram of a typical cradle is included in the Haulage Manual)</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">The Haulage Master or his representative retains the right to refuse haulage of boats on sub-standard cradles.&nbsp;</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Cradles must fit on one trolley only and will not be permitted to use two trolleys. This is due to the slipways not being of one continuous angle.</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Bottle screws and chains have inherent problems and should not be used unless a current test certificate is available.&nbsp;</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Cradles must be clearly named and must meet the Club’s standards for size and construction.</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Cradle bearers may be stored as directed in designated areas over summer.</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Cradles for boats that have not been used in the last two years must be removed from the Club premises. If said cradles are not removed the Club may remove or dispose of these cradles as the committee sees fit.</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Cradles must be dismantled and removed from the vicinity of the slipways within 24 hours of launching.&nbsp;<a name="6"></a></span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">The Haulage Committee has the right to charge a penal rate for the storage of any cradle not complying with rule 5J and 5K.</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">On the base of steel cradles, no timber shall protrude beyond the steelwork in any direction.</span></li>
   </ol>
   <p><strong  class="btn btn-black">6. Usage of Facilities</strong></p>
   <ol>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Noise nuisance to the community is not permitted. Halyards must be removed or effectively secured; mechanical equipment effectively silenced.&nbsp;</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Spray painting, grinding and sandblasting is forbidden.</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">A rubbish collection is not provided. All rubbish must be removed from the section immediately.&nbsp;</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">All materials removed from boat, i.e. loose paint, shavings etc., must be re-moved from the area around the boat daily.</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">The Club does not allow the stowage of flammable materials in member’s boats (including fuel and outboard motors) hauled out on the section.<a name="7"></a></span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">The Club does not allow the use of battery chargers in member’s boats hauled out, unless there is a responsible person in attendance whilst battery charger is in operation.</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">The removal and application of any/all antifouling paints must comply with controls set out in Appendix A,</span></li>
   </ol>
   <p><strong  class="btn btn-black">7. Liability</strong></p>
   <ol>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Members of the Devonport Yacht Club are reminded that the hauling out facility and side haulage is a cooperative service allowed by the Club within certain guidelines for the benefit of full members only.</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">The Club therefore takes no responsibility whatsoever for damage to vessels either in the course of hauling out, launching, side hauling or during their stor-age on the hard adjacent to the yacht Club.&nbsp;</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Vessels being hauled must be covered by Insurance that will protect the owner and the Club from any liability while it is hauled and stored on the Club premises using the Clubs equipment. The Haulage Master may require to sight an Insurance Cover Note before permitting haulage. The risk in the vessel at all times remains with the owner who has final responsibility for the safety and security of the vessel.<a name="8"></a></span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">It is the owner’s responsibility to become familiar with the haulage gear and procedures and to ensure that the people working around his boat do not get in-jured or take risks.</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">It is the owners responsibility to keep the area tidy and free from all hazards (see also 6D above ).</span></li>
   </ol>
   <p><strong  class="btn btn-black">8. Penalties</strong></p>
   <ol>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Boats not launched as programmed in the Downhaul Schedule that require to be moved to allow the movement of other craft, shall be liable for extra haulage charges of $30.00 per movement.</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Boats, that are unable to be moved and delay the launch of other craft, thus incurring a penalty for those craft, will be liable to all penalty charges for those craft.</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Boats on still on the section including slipways other than with the express ap-proval of the Committee after the conclusion date of winter haulage as deter-mined by the Haulage Committee and advised in the Downhaul Schedule (normally 30th November) may be liable for a penalty charge of up to $2000</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Cradles shall be dismantled within 24 hours of launching and stacked neatly in the areas provided. Failure to do so could require the removal of the offending cradle and a penalty charge for both the dismantling and the storage of said cradle.&nbsp;<a name="9"></a></span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Any haulage accounts overdue in excess of 3 months from the date of invoicing without a payment plan with the Club being agreed to may be placed in the hands of a Debt Collector for recovery of monies owed.</span></li>
   </ol>
   <p><strong  class="btn btn-black">9. Winter Haulage</strong></p>

   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Haulage Application Forms (small version) are in the yearbook and available on the website while the large version will be available in the foyer of the Club.&nbsp;</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Boat in the Way: If a boat is impeding haulage, <a name="10"></a>the Club will make every endeavour to contact the owner to get him to shift the boat. If these best endeavours are to no avail then the Club reserves the right to move the boat with no liability to the Club or Club members and will charge the owner for this move. Any boat unable to be moved which hinders the timely launch of another vessel or vessels beyond the winter haulage cut off date may be liable for the penalty payments of all effected boats.</span></li>

   <p>&nbsp;<strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">NOTE:</span></strong></p>
   <p>1. It is the Responsibility of the Boat Owner to organise the Haulage Operators when the Boat Owner requires the use of ANY winch. <br>2. Haulage Operators as listed above are to be given five (5) Days notice of ANY re-quirements for the operation of ANY winch.<a name="20"></a><br>3. Two Haulage Operators are required for each haul and the first Operator contacted and available should organize his assistant.<a name="19"></a><br>4. It is the Yacht Clubs expectation that ALL haulage will be carried out during week-ends, as the availability of haulage operators during weekdays may be problematic.</p>
   <p><strong  class="btn btn-black">19. Guidelines and controls for the removal of antifouling paint</strong></p>
   <p>Environmental Protection Act rules require that any antifoul removed from a boat is collected and disposed of correctly. This includes wet sanding, scraping and water blasting. Dry sanding at the DYC is prohibited.</p>
   <ul>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Water blasting of the hull must occur on the slipways using the sump and sump pump. In addition, portable screening must be used to contain overspray.</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Appropriate protective gear must be worn when both water blasting and wet sand-ing.</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Further details of what is considered appropriate gear will be made available to boat owners hauling.</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Where practical, boat owners are encouraged to undertake any wet sanding of an-tifoul on the slipway (using the sump and pumps). Discuss this with the haulage master if this option is preferred.&nbsp;</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Wet sanding of antifoul may occur on the section, but boat owners must ensure that all run off is collected and disposed of.&nbsp;</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">No antifoul or material containing antifoul is allowed to run onto the ground under any circumstances.</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">In order to ensure wet sanding run off is appropriately collected, boat owners will need to ensure the following:<br></span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">- Boat cradles are blocked up on the section so as to enable appropriate groundsheets and bunding to be used when wet sanding (the haulage team can assist and advise with this when side hauling);<br></span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">- Appropriate heavy duty water proof ground sheets and bunding are used under the hull to ensure all run off can be collected and disposed of in the holding tank<br></span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">- If you have doubts about how to ensure you are doing the right thing, ask for ad-vice before starting.</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Some thought will be required by boat owners as to position of boats and cradles and how they are blocked up. The haulage team can assist with this when side hauling.</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">The Club has some heavy duty groundsheets, portable bunding and a wet and dry vacuum cleaner available for boat owners to use. However, responsibility of ensuring the right equipment is available and used, and ensuring the correct collection and disposal of antifoul occurs, at all times remains that of the boat owner.</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Boat owners should minimise the amount of runoff to be collected when wet sand-ing (e.g. using flow control to reduce the amount of water used) to ensure the waste storage tank is not overloaded&nbsp;</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">All scraping of antifoul paint must be done with a vacuum scraper.</span></li>
   </ul>
   <p><strong  class="btn btn-black">Application of Antifoul Paint</strong></p>
   <p>The new rules introduce specific requirements for signage to ensure members of the public are aware of paint application occurring. In addition, certain protective and safety gear is now mandatory when applying antifoul paint.</p>
   <ul>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">The Club has portable temporary signage and warnings which all boat owners must use when applying anti foul paint.</span></li>
   <li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Personal protective clothing must be worn/used to ensure no skin contact with anti-fouling paint.</span></li>
   </ul>
   <p>It is also noted that these guidelines also apply in the event a boat owner engages an-other party to undertake any work relating to antifoul. Responsibility for en-suring these rules are met by all parties working on a boat remains that of the boat owner.</p>
